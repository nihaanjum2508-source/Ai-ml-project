# Mini Project – Probabilistic Reasoning on System Data (Part 1)

ai ml mini 2 project with easy data set

Name:Niha anjum.I
Course:Btech IT
Year:1st year

## Dataset
easy_queue_data.csv

## Method Used
Naive Bayes Classification and K means Clustering 

## Objective
To reason under uncertainty using probabilities instead of focusing on accuracy.

## Files Included
- part1_naive_bayes.py – Python implementation
- Part1_Naive_Bayes_Code.pdf – Code in PDF format
- Mini_Project_Part1_Probabilistic_Reasoning.pdf – Project explanation
- easy_queue_data.csv – Dataset

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates that:
- Machine learning models operate with uncertainty
- Probabilistic outputs are more informative than hard predictions
- Model failures are expected and acceptable in real-world systems
